_This todo list describes ChrisAnt996's current intended roadmap for Clink's future.  It is a living document and does not convey any guarantee about when or whether any item may be implemented._

<br/>

# IMPROVEMENTS

## High Priority

## Medium Priority
- Readline command reference.
- Add more Readline documentation into the Clink docs.

## Low Priority
- Collecting matches for suggestions:
  - Can matches be collected on demand for suggestions?  So that if no configured autosuggest strategies use matches, then the match pipeline would not even collect matches.
  - Can suggestions and match collection use a coroutine to avoid stuttering when match collection takes a while?
- Add command and flag descriptions in clink-completions?
- Push update to clink-completions repo.
- Push update to z.lua repo.
- Auto-update option, with configurable polling interval?  (Though package managers like scoop can handle updates, if Clink was installed through one.)

## Mystery

<br/>
<br/>

# INVESTIGATE

**Popup Lists**
- Ability to delete, rearrange, and edit popup list items?  _[Can't realistically rearrange or edit history, due to how the history file format works.]_

**Installer**

**Miscellaneous**
- Include `wildmatch()` and an `fnmatch()` wrapper for it.  But should first update it to support UTF8.

<br/>
<br/>

# MAINTENANCE

- Readline 8.1 has slight bug in `update_line`; type `c` then `l`, and it now identifies **2** chars (`cl`) as needing to be displayed; seems like the diff routine has a bug with respect to the new faces capability; it used to only identify `l` as needing to be displayed.

# APPENDICES

## Manual Test Verifications
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd> to scroll up a line.
- `git add ` in Cmder.
- `git checkout `<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>=</kbd> in Cmder.

## Known Issues
- Perturbed PROMPT envvar is visible in child processes (e.g. piped shell in various file editors).
- [#531](https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/531) AV detects a trojan on download _[This is likely because of the use of CreateRemoteThread and/or hooking OS APIs.  There might be a way to obfuscate the fact that clink uses those, but ultimately this is kind of an inherent problem.  Getting the binaries digitally signed might be the most effective solution, but that's financially expensive.]_
- [Terminal #10191](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/10191#issuecomment-897345862) Microsoft Terminal does not allow a console application to know about or access the scrollback history, nor to scroll the screen.  It blocks Clink's scrolling commands, and also the `console.findline()` function and everything else that relies on access to the scrollback history.

## Mystery
- Windows 10.0.19042.630 seems to have problems when using WriteConsoleW with ANSI escape codes in a powerline prompt in a git repo.  But Windows 10.0.19041.630 doesn't.
- Windows Terminal crashes on exit after `clink inject`.  The current release version was crashing (1.6.10571.0).  Older versions don't crash, and a locally built version from the terminal repo's HEAD doesn't crash.  I think the crash is probably a bug in Windows Terminal, not related to Clink.  And after I built it locally, then it stopped crashing with 1.6.10571.0 as well.  Mysterious...

## Punt
- Make scrolling key bindings work at the pager prompt.  Note that it would need to revise how the scroll routines identify the bottom line (currently they use Readline's bottom line, but the pager displays output past that point).  _[Low value; also, Windows Terminal has scrolling hotkeys that supersede Clink, and it can scroll regardless whether prompting for input.  Further, Windows Terminal is deprecating the ability for an app to scroll the screen anyway.]_
- Is it a problem that `update_internal()` gets called once per char in a key sequence?  Maybe it should only happen after a key that finishes a key binding?  _[Doesn't cause any noticeable issues.]_
- Provide API to show an input box?  But make it fail if used from outside a "luafunc:" macro.  _[Questionable usage pattern; just make the "luafunc:" macro invoke a standalone program (or even standalone Lua script) that can accept input however it likes.]_
- Classify queued input lines?  _[Low value, high cost; the module layer knows about coloring, but queued lines are handled by the host layer without ever reaching the module layer.  Also, the queued input lines ("More?") do not adhere to the current parsing assumptions; it would become necessary to carry argmatcher state across lines.  Also, argmatchers do not currently understand `(` or `)`.]_
- Support this quirk, or not?  <kbd>Esc</kbd> in conhost clears the line but does not reset the history index, but in Clink it resets the history index.  Affects F1, F2, F3, F5, F8.  _[Defer until someone explains why it's important to them.]_
- Additional ANSI escape codes.
  - `ESC[?47h` and `ESC[?47l` (save and restore screen) -- not widely supported, so I can't use it, and it's not worth emulating.  Which makes me very sad; no save + show popup + restore. ðŸ˜­
  - `ESC[?1049h` and `ESC[?1049l` (enable and disable alternative buffer) -- not worth using or emulating; there's no way to copying between screens, so it can't help for save/popup/restore.
- Marking mode in-app is not realistic:
  - Windows Terminal is essentially dropping support for console APIs that read/write the screen buffer, particularly the scrollback buffer.
  - Different terminal hosts have different capabilities and limitations, so building a marking mode that behaves reasonably across all/most terminal hosts isn't feasible.
  - One of the big opportunities for terminal hosts is to provide enhancements to marking and copy/paste.
  - So it seems best to leave marking and copy/paste as something for terminal hosts to provide.
- Lua API to copy text to clipboard (plain text or HTML) is not realistic, for the same technical reasons as for marking mode.
- Would be nice to complete "%ENVVAR%\*" by internally expanding ENVVAR for collecting matches, but not expanding it in the editing line.  However, it's difficult to make that work reasonably in conjunction with path normalization.
- [ConsoleZ](https://github.com/cbucher/console) sometimes draws the prompt in the wrong color:  scroll up, then type => the prompt is drawn in the input color instead of in the default color.  It doesn't happen in conhost or ConEmu or Windows Terminal.  Debugging indicates Clink is _not_ redrawing the prompt, so it's entirely an internal issue inside ConsoleZ.
- Max input line length:
  - CMD has a max input buffer size of 8192 WCHARs including the NUL terminator.
  - ReadConsole does not allow more input than can fit in the input buffer size.
  - Readline allows infinite input size, and has no way to limit it.
  - There is a truncation problem here that does not exist without Clink.
  - However, even CMD itself silently fails to run an inputted command over 8100 characters, despite allowing 8191 characters to be input.
  - So I'm comfortable punting this for now.
- A way to disable/enable clink once injected.  _[Why?]_
- Provide API to generate HTML string from console text.  _[Too complicated; also impossible to support more than 4-bit color.]_
- [#486](https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/486) **Ctrl+C** doesn't always work properly _[Unrelated to Clink; the exact same behavior occurs with plain cmd.exe]_
